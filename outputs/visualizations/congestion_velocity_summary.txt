Analysis of average taxi speeds inside Manhattan Congestion Zone (south of 60th St)
Comparison: Q1 2024 (before congestion pricing) vs Q1 2025 (after implementation)

YELLOW TAXIS:
  Q1 2024 Average Speed: 13.39 MPH
  Q1 2025 Average Speed: 13.16 MPH
  Change: -0.23 MPH (-1.73%)
  → MINIMAL CHANGE - Congestion pricing has little effect on speeds

  Q1 2025 Average Speed: 12.61 MPH
  Change: +0.29 MPH (+2.39%)

==================================================
OVERALL ASSESSMENT OF CONGESTION PRICING IMPACT:
-->LITTLE EVIDENCE that congestion pricing improved traffic flow
   Taxi speeds show minimal or negative change

HYPOTHESIS TEST: 'Did the toll actually speed up traffic?'
⚠ PARTIALLY SUPPORTED: Small speed increase (0.3%)
