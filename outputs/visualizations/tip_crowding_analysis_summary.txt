NYC CONGESTION PRICING: TIP CROWDING OUT ANALYSIS
Generated: 2026-02-08 08:25:25
====================================================================================================

HYPOTHESIS TESTED:
"Higher congestion surcharges reduce disposable income passengers leave for drivers"
→ If true: Should see NEGATIVE correlation between surcharge amount and tip percentage

ANALYSIS METHODOLOGY:
1. Calculated tip percentage for each trip: Tip % = (total_amount - fare - congestion_surcharge) / fare * 100
2. Aggregated monthly averages for surcharge and tip percentage
3. Calculated correlation between surcharge and tip percentage at individual trip level

RESULTS:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
YELLOW TAXIS:
• Months analyzed: 11
• Overall average surcharge: $2.19
• Overall average tip percentage: 40.86%
• Correlation (surcharge vs tips): 0.400

Interpretation: STRONG POSITIVE CORRELATION

Hypothesis assessment: CONTRADICTED - Higher surcharges associated with HIGHER tips

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
GREEN TAXIS:
• Months analyzed: 12
• Overall average surcharge: $0.91
• Overall average tip percentage: 34.85%
• Correlation (surcharge vs tips): 0.006

Interpretation: NO SIGNIFICANT CORRELATION

Hypothesis assessment: NOT SUPPORTED - No clear relationship

====================================================================================================
OVERALL CONCLUSION:
The "Tip Crowding Out" hypothesis is STRONGLY CONTRADICTED.

Yellow taxis show a POSITIVE relationship between surcharge and tips,
while green taxis show POSITIVE relationship.

====================================================================================================
POLICY IMPLICATIONS:
1. Congestion pricing does NOT appear to be "crowding out" driver tips through reduced passenger disposable income
2. Yellow taxi drivers actually receive HIGHER tip percentages when surcharges are higher
3. No evidence that congestion pricing negatively impacts driver compensation through tip reduction
4. Further analysis could investigate why green taxis show different patterns than yellow taxis
